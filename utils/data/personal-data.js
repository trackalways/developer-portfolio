  description: "I am Iwashu Jain, currently based in Bhopal, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Journalism and Mass Communication from Jagran Lakecity University (JLU). I have always believed in learning through doing, which has led me to explore multiple professional paths, internships, and creative ventures early in my career. My journey so far has been shaped by curiosity, adaptability, and a deep passion for storytelling—whether through visuals, design, performance, or digital media. I am also a dance teacher for the past four years, training over 1,000 students. My ambition is to grow into a designer and video editor who blends design, storytelling, and technology seamlessly—someone who understands how to stay relevant and lead in a constantly changing digital landscape.",
